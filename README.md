051223 Setting up this repository to complete this challenge
  created folders PyBank and PyPoll
  
0513 Was successful in pushing from Bash to GitHub.  GitHub does not like empty folders so was not able to add the "analysis" folders to the PyBank and PyPoll folders but will when it contains the applicable txt file. Worked around this by adding a .gitkeep file to each analysis folder, followed by git add, git commit, git pull, git pull.
